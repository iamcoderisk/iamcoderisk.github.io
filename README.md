# PRINCE DARLINGTON 

## ABOUT

I show deep technical judgment, expanding to the depths of my team's technology ownership. I impart this judgment on others and are sought for advice on all aspects of my team's product, process, and technology.

I can guide architectural decisions on my team and across teams with an eye to high-level tradeoffs, and know when and how to explore novel approaches. I am a backstop for on-call issues on my team. 9+ years industry experience working in SaaS and distributed systems environments. Experience working with large-scale data-oriented systems on a major cloud provider.

## About Me

Passionate about building scalable infrastructure systems for both internal and external customers.
I  have worked on testing websites across various browsers, operating systems, and devices making necessary adjustments for quality assurance such as improving website speed and functionality or minimizing downtime, or fixing broken links, and other day-to-day maintenance.
Above all, I may not have all the required tech skills, but have it in mind that i can also learn them and adjust to fit into any company.
